    Take it one step at a time:


    1. It''s given that A = 1.


    2. The variable C is defined as equal to the value of A. So by substituting the
    value of A into C, we sell that C = 1.


    3. Now, we know the value of D is equal to the value of C. So substitute the value
    of C into D, D = 1.


    So, the value of D is 1.'

    1. B is assigned the value 1.

  sampled_answer: 'The solution to this problem is easier than it might seem at first
    glance, because many of the variables are just defined to be equal to other variables.
    Let''s solve it step-by-step:


    1. A = 7: This is the base variable. The variable A is defined to have the value
    7.

    2. K = A: The variable K is defined to be equal to A. Since we know that A equals
    7, therefore, K = 7.

    3. L = K: L is defined to be equal to K. Since we know that K equals 7, therefore,
    L = 7.

    4. M = L: M is defined to be equal to L. Since we know that L equals 7, therefore,
    M = 7.

    5. N = M: N is defined to be equal to M. Since we know that M equals 7, therefore,
    N = 7.

    6. O = N: O is defined to be equal to N. Since we know that N equals 7, therefore,
    O = 7.

    7. P = O: P is defined to be equal to O. Since we know that O equals 7, therefore,
    P = 7.

    8. Q = P: Q is defined to be equal to P. Since we know that P equals 7, therefore,
    Q = 7.

    9. R = Q: R is defined to be equal to Q. Since we know that Q equals 7, therefore,
    R = 7.

    10. S = R: S is defined to be equal to R. Since we know that R equals 7, therefore,
    S = 7.

    11. T = S: Finally, T is defined to be equal to S. From the above, we know that
    S equals 7.


    So T = 7. Your final result is T = 7.'
