  sampled_answer: 'We are given the values of the variables A, B, and C, and we are
    asked to find the value of D.


    We know that C is equal to B, and D is equal to C. We can substitute the value
    of C with the value of B in the equation for D.


    Given:

    A = 0

    B = 1

    C = B


    Substituting the value of C with B:

    D = C

    D = B


    Now, we know that B = 1, so we can substitute the value of B in the equation for
    D.


    D = B

    D = 1


    Therefore, D is equal to 1.'
